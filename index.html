        <article>chunkFS: A Distributed File System from scratch in Java.</article>
        <details>
          <ul>
            <li>Developed a Distributed File System from scratch in Java, featuring a Command Line Interface
              (CLI) and multithreading Name Server & Chunk Servers. Successfully deployed the system over a
              local network comprising of Linux and Windows machines.
            <li>Implemented a Request-Response model for method invocations, similar to RMI technology.
            <li>Designed a Name Server that relies on a custom database facility (Name Server Registry), storing
              and managing records in the form of Inode objects.
            <li>Enforced user management through the “root” user, allowing all users to perform actions like
              "put" or "get" files, "create" or "remove" directories, and enforcing permissions over their files
              with "root" user exclusivity.
            <li>Partitioned files into chunks (up to 5MB) for uploading and sent them serially to the chunk servers
              via the name server upon initiation of “put” request. Recollected those chunks from the chunk
              servers via the name server upon a “get” request and correctly reconstructed the file to save it.
            <li>Distributed and replicated chunks by following Round-Robin strategy.
            <li>Assigned canonical names to the chunk servers to maintain consistency in the name server's
              registry even after the chunk server has been relocated to another IP address.
            <li>Assigned dual roles to the chunk servers to behave as primary and/or secondary storage servers.
            <li>Configurable aspects (IP address, port, etc.) of the Name Server, Chunk Server, and the CLI can be
              modified through dedicated configuration files.

          Raspberry Pi 3B+ bootable image: GPIO and Mini-UART driversRaspberry Pi 3B+ bootable image: GPIO and Mini-UART
          drivers
          In my quest to learn RTOS development using C, I attempted to develop a small bootable image for the Raspberry
          Pi 3B+ based on Broadcom’s BCM2837B0 SoC and ARM’s Cortex-A53 quad-core processor. Key accomplishments
          include:
          <ul>
            <li>development of a boot loader script in assembly language following the ARMv8-A instruction set for
              lowering down the exception level of the main core from EL3 to EL1.
            <li>booting of the image at the physical address 0x0 as opposed to the default address 0x80000 through a
              custom linker script.
            <li>making all the secondary cores spin in a loop, delegating all the tasks thereafter to the main core.
            <li>assigning a 512-byte stack to the main core and making the main core jump from the assembly code to the
              “void cpu0_main(void)” function in C.
            <li>development of a minimal mini-UART driver for the display of messages onto the console.
            <li>development of a minimal GPIO driver for controlling hardware components.
            <li>development of an imitated version of “stdint.h” and “stdbool.h” headers for handling register addresses
              and program-wide constants.
            <li>development of “delay.h” header for software-enforced delay, synchronizing its working with processor’s
              operating frequency
            <li>development of a batch script for automatic build of the image in a single click.
          </ul>
          The bootable image was emulated on QEMU, and the registers were thoroughly observed by interfacing QEMU with
          the GDB debugger over the localhost via port 1234.
          <p>
            References for developing the drivers were drawn from the Broadcom BCM2837B0 peripheral manual, and the
            “aarch64-none-elf” toolchain (cross-compiler) was employed for building the image.

          MiniURL: An URL shortener web application in PHP using MVC architecture.
        </article>
        <details>
          I developed a PHP-based web application leveraging the MVC architecture with a custom router implementation
          that enables users to shorten their URLs. The application was deployed over a local network (192.168.43.0/24),
          comprised of computers with distinct roles:
          <ul>
            <li> 192.168.43.45/24: MySQL Database Server
            <li>192.168.43.67/24: Apache Web Server
            <li>192.168.43.10/24: DNS Server
            <li>Other IPs in the network 192.168.43.0/24 (except broadcast and network): Client
          </ul>
          Assigned domain names “www.miniurl.com” to 192.168.43.67/24 (the Apache Web Server) and “database.miniurl.com”
          to 192.168.43.45/24 (the MySQL Database Server) via the BIND9 DNS server on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

          This application:
          <ul>
            <li> allows anonymous users to shorten their URLs, view the click-count of their links, and create accounts.
            <li>offers extra control over the shortened URLs to registered users: modifying aliases, temporary
              deactivation,
              and permanent deletion of the URL(s).
            <li> generates shortened URLs like "www.miniurl.com/u/urlid", with a 5-character long "urlid" (customizable
              with
              a length 1-10)
            <li>allows registered users to change their account passwords and delete their accounts.
            <li>utilizes PHP’s built-in $_SESSION variable for effective context management across web pages.
            <li>ensures persistent login with PHP's $_COOKIE variable even after the browser has been closed.
          </ul>

          ML++: A vectorized machine learning library for regression and classification
        </article>
        <details>
          This serves as my final semester project and is currently in progress.

          I have chosen C++ for this project as it supports "operator overloading", which is useful for software-level
          "vectorization" and is very much coupled to the hardware, which accounts for speed. Moreover, compilers for
          C++ exist for almost any target architecture, and the programs can be optimized for performance and
          instructions.
          <ul>
            This library will:
            <li> imitate "vectorization" through operator overloading, accounting for fast computations.
            <li>be able to perform regression and/or classification (as applicable) over multi-variable and
              multi-variate datasets.
            <li>consist of a CSV parser/reader for representing datasets.
            <li>consist of a DataFrame object for manipulating the dataset: dropping of columns, partitioning of the
              dataset, normalization & standardization of input features, and one-hot encoding of the output.
            <li>plot an interactive graph using "matplotlibcpp.h" for the loss V/s epoch and compute metrics (MSE or
              RMSE) for assessing the model's performance.
          </ul>
